# Level of Detail (LOD) add-on for Godot 3.x

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Calinou/media/master/godot-lod-demo/screenshot.png)

This add-on provides level of detail for meshes, lights and particles.
It can be used to improve performance in large scenes significantly.

This repository only contains the add-on. See
[godot-extended-libraries/godot-lod-demo](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-lod-demo)
for the demonstration project.

## Features

- Supports lights, meshes and particles (Particles and CPUParticles).
- Each node has its own LOD distance properties, but you can also define a LOD
  bias project setting to improve visual quality or performance for the target
  hardware.
- Lights can have their shadow smoothly fade off with distance, then the light
  itself smoothly fade off as well.
- Works with both the GLES3 and GLES2 renderers.
- Written in performance-conscious GDScript. Easy to install and use, but scales
  to hundreds of LOD instances (and perhaps thousands on more powerful
  hardware).

The LOD add-on only runs in the running project, not while in the editor.
This is done by design to avoid accidentally saving modified versions of the scene.
You need to run the project to test LOD functionality.

## Installation

### Using the Asset Library

- Open the Godot editor.
- Navigate to the **AssetLib** tab at the top of the editor and search for
  "lod".
- Install the
  [*Level of Detail (LOD)*](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/729)
  plugin. Keep all files checked during installation.
- In the editor, open **Project > Project Settings**, go to **Plugins**
  and enable the **Level of Detail (LOD)** plugin.

### Manual installation

Manual installation lets you use pre-release versions of this add-on by
following its `master` branch.

- Clone this Git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-lod.git
```

Alternatively, you can
[download a ZIP archive](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-lod/archive/master.zip)
if you do not have Git installed.

- Move the `addons/` folder to your project folder.
- In the editor, open **Project > Project Settings**, go to **Plugins**
  and enable the **Level of Detail (LOD)** plugin.

## Usage

### Meshes

1. After enabling the plugin (see above), add a LODSpatial node.
2. Add 2 or 3 child nodes. These must have with the `-lod0` (high detail),
   `-lod1` (medium detail) or `-lod2` (low detail). **`-lod2` is optional.**
   If you only have the `-lod0` and `-lod1` LOD levels (high and low), keep in
   mind the node will be invisible if `-lod2` should be displayed given the
   current distance.

   Your scene tree should now look like this:

    ```text
    - LODSpatial
      - MeshInstance-lod0
      - MeshInstance-lod1
      - MeshInstance-lod2
      - (other, unrelated nodes can be placed here too)
    ```

3. Configure the distance properties in the LODSpatial node.
4. To smoothly fade out the least detailed LOD before it disappears completely,
   see [TIPS.md](TIPS.md).

**Note:** As its name implies, LODSpatial is not limited to MeshInstances. It
can hide and show any node that inherits from Spatial.

### Lights

1. After enabling the plugin (see above), add a LODOmniLight or LODSpotLight node.
2. Configure the node as you would configure a typical light node.
3. Set a maximum light and shadow distance in the inspector. By default, lights will
   no longer be visible at all if the camera is more than 50 units away. Their shadows
   will also no longer be visible if the camera is move than 25 units away.
4. You can also configure the fade factors to make the fade-in less dramatic.
   This can be useful to make transitions less noticeable if the camera moves
   quickly.

**Note:** Since the light's energy will be tweaked for LOD purposes, don't
change it manually while the project is running. You can still set a fixed
energy value in the inspector, though. The add-on will take it into account for
its calculations. To change the light's intensity over time (e.g. using
AnimationPlayer), darken or lighten its color instead.

**Note:** If you add child nodes to a LODOmniLight or LODSpotLight, they will no
longer be visible if the light is fully hidden due to the distance.

### Particles

1. After enabling the plugin (see above), add a LODParticles or LODCPUParticles node.
2. Configure the node as you would configure a typical particles node.
3. Set a maximum emission distance in the inspector. By default, particles will
   no longer emit if the camera is more than 50 units away.

You can safely add child nodes to a LODParticles or LODCPUParticles node, as the
node itself is never hidden.

## Configuration

There are several Project Settings you can define to customize this add-on's
behavior. You can set them directly in a script
(`ProjectSettings.set_setting("section/key", value)`) or use the Project
Settings in the editor to do so.

### `lod/spatial_bias`, `lod/light_bias`, `lod/particle_bias`

*Default:* `0`

The distance bias (in 3D units) to use for LOD calculations. Positive values
will improve performance at the cost of visual quality, whereas negative values
will improve visual quality at the cost of performance.

### `lod/refresh_threshold_ms`

*Default:* `5`

How much time can be used to update LOD meshes, lights and particle instances (in milliseconds). Higher
values allow more LODs to be processed at once but uses more CPU.

## Tips and tricks

See [TIPS.md](TIPS.md) for useful tips on improving performance and visual
quality of your 3D project. These tips can be followed even if you don't use
this add-on.
